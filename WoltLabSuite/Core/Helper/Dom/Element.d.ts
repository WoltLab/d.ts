/**
 * Decorators to allow runtime access to DOM elements
 * in a fragment of the DOM without requiring to manually
 * fetch the elements. Depends on `DomView` to access
 * a scoped part of the DOM instead of running selectors
 * against the entire document.
 *
 * The decorators will create new getters on the prototype
 * to access the elements. This collides with the
 * `useDefineForClassFields` setting of TypeScript that
 * will emit properties for class fields.
 *
 * WARNING: You MUST prepend `declare` to your properties
 * that are upgraded with these decorators.
 *
 * Based on the ideas of GitHubâ€™s Catalyst library.
