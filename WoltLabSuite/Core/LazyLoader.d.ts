/**
 * Efficient lazy loader that executes a callback once a selector matches
 * for the first time and the document has finished loading.
 *
 * Designed for actions that do not require eager execution, such as
 * binding specific event listeners on runtime. It should not be used for
 * components that alter the visible UI to prevent layout shifts.
 *
 * Based on the work of GitHubâ€˜s Catalyst library (MIT license).
