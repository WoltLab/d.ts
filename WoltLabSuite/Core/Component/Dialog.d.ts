/**
 * The `dialogFactory()` offers a consistent way to
 * create modal dialogs. Dialogs can be used to inform
 * the user of an important message, to prompt them to
 * make a decision (see `confirmationFactory()`) or to
 * ask them to fill out a form.
 *
 * Dialogs interrupt a userâ€™s flow on a page and thus
 * should only be used sparingly. Please refer to the
 * docs at https://docs.woltlab.com/ to learn more
 * about the different dialog types and how to best
 * use them.
